IE517 - Machine Learning in Finance Laboratory Research Project - We replicate the techniques used in https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4000756 to price american call option using neural network

Our contribution
-We show that Gradient Boosting technique can further improve the model performance in reducing the Mean Absolute Error (from 2.63 cents to 2.14 cents) while sacrificing a little amount of prediction time assuming the prediction is done sequentially. The tradeoff however can be eliminated using parallel programming.
