Our contribution
-We show that Gradient Boosting Neural Networks can further improve the performance from the paper (plain neural network), reducing the Mean Absolute Error (from 2.63 cents to 2.14 cents) while sacrificing a little amount of prediction time assuming the prediction is done sequentially. The drawback however can be eliminated using parallel programming.
